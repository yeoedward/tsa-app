# Installing
```
$ npm install pg-promise
```

# Testing

```
$ npm install
```
* Run tests
```
$ make test
```
On Windows you can also run tests with `test.bat`

# Getting started

### 1. Load the library
```javascript
// Loading the library:
var pgpLib = require('pg-promise');
```
### 2. Initialize the library
```javascript
// Initializing the library, with optional global settings:
var pgp = pgpLib(/*options*/);
```
You can pass additional `options` parameter when initializing the library (see chapter [Initialization Options](#advanced) for details).

### 3. Configure database connection
Use one of the two ways to specify connection details:
* Configuration Object:
```javascript
var cn = {
    host: 'localhost', // server name or IP address;
    port: 5432,
    database: 'my_db_name',
    user: 'user_name',
    password: 'user_password'
};
```
* Connection String:
```javascript
var cn = "postgres://username:password@host:port/database";
```
This library doesn't use any of the connection's details, it simply passes them on to [PG] when opening a new connection.
For more details see pg connection parameters in [WiKi](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/pg#parameters) and
[implementation](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/master/lib/connection-parameters.js).

### 4. Instantiate your database
```javascript
var db = pgp(cn); // create a new database instance from the connection details
```
There can be multiple database objects instantiated in the application from different connection details.

You are now ready to make queries against the database.

# Usage

The library supports promise-chained queries on shared and detached connections.
Choosing which one you want depends on the situation and personal preferences.

### Detached Connections

Queries in a detached promise chain maintain connection independently, they each acquire a connection from the pool,
execute the query and then release the connection.
```javascript
db.one("select * from users where id=$1", 123) // find the user from id;
    .then(function(data){
        // find 'login' records for the user found:
        return db.query("select * from audit where event=$1 and userId=$2",
        ["login", data.id]);
    })
    .then(function(data){
        // display found audit records;
        console.log(data);
    }, function(reason){
        console.log(reason); // display reason why the call failed;
    })
```
In a situation where a single request is to be made against the database, a detached chain is the only one that makes sense.
And even if you intend to execute multiple queries in a chain, keep in mind that even though each will use its own connection,
such will be used from a connection pool, so effectively you end up with the same connection, without any performance penalty.

### Shared Connections

A promise chain with a shared connection always starts with ```connect()```, which allocates a connection that's shared with all the
query requests down the promise chain. The connection must be released when no longer needed.

```javascript
var sco; // shared connection object;
db.connect()
    .then(function(obj){
        sco = obj; // save the connection object;
        // find active users created before today:
        return sco.query("select * from users where active=$1 and created < $2::date", [true, new Date()]);
    })
    .then(function(data){
        console.log(data); // display all the user details;
    }, function(reason){
        console.log(reason); // display reason why the call failed;
    })
    .done(function(){
        if(sco){
            sco.done(); // release the connection, if it was successful;
        }
    });
```
Shared-connection chaining is for those who want absolute control over connection, either because they want to execute lots of queries in one go,
or because they like squeezing every bit of performance out of their code. Other than, the author hasn't seen any real performance difference
from the detached-connection chaining.

### Transactions

Transactions can be executed within both shared and detached promise chains in the same way, performing the following actions:

1. Acquires a new connection (detached chains only);
2. Executes `BEGIN` command;
3. Invokes your callback function with the connection object;
4. Executes `COMMIT`, if the callback resolves, or `ROLLBACK`, if the callback rejects;
5. Releases the connection (detached chains only);
6. Resolves with the callback result, if success; rejects with the reason, if failed.

###### Example of a detached transaction:

```javascript
var promise = require('promise'); // or any other supported promise library;
db.tx(function(ctx){

    // creating a sequence of transaction queries:
    var q1 = ctx.none("update users set active=$1 where id=$2", [true, 123]);
    var q2 = ctx.one("insert into audit(entity, id) values($1, $2) returning id", ['users', 123]);

    // returning a promise that determines a successful transaction:
    return promise.all([q1, q2]); // all of the queries are to be resolved

}).then(function(data){
    console.log(data); // printing successful transaction output
}, function(reason){
    console.log(reason); // printing the reason why the transaction was rejected
});
```
A detached transaction acquires a connection and exposes object `ctx` to let all containing queries execute on the same connection.

And when executing a transaction within a shared connection chain, the only thing that changes is that parameter `ctx` becomes the
same as parameter `sco` from opening a shared connection, so either one can be used inside such a transaction interchangeably.

###### Shared-connection transaction:
```javascript
var promise = require('promise'); // or any other supported promise library;
var sco; // shared connection object;
db.connect()
    .then(function(obj){
        sco = obj;
        return sco.oneOrNone("select * from users where active=$1 and id=$1", [true, 123]);
    })
    .then(function(data){
        return sco.tx(function(ctx){

            // Since it is a transaction within a shared chain, it doesn't matter whether
            // the two calls below use object `ctx` or `sco`, as they are exactly the same:
            var q1 = ctx.none("update users set active=$1 where id=$2", [false, data.id]);
            var q2 = sco.one("insert into audit(entity, id) values($1, $2) returning id", ['users', 123]);

            // returning a promise that determines a successful transaction:
            return promise.all([q1, q2]); // all of the queries are to be resolved;
        });
    }, function(reason){
        console.log(reason); // printing the reason why the transaction was rejected;
    })
    .done(function(){
        if(sco){
            sco.done(); // release the connection, if it was successful;
        }
    });
```
If you need to execute just one transaction, the detached transaction pattern is all you need.
But even if you need to combine it with other queries in then a detached chain, it will work just as fine.
As stated earlier, choosing a shared chain over a detached one is mostly a matter of special requirements and/or personal preference.

###### Nested Transactions

Starting with version 0.5.6, the library supports nested transactions.

Similar to the shared-connection transactions, nested transactions automatically share the connection between all levels.
This library sets no limitation as to the depth (nesting levels) of transactions supported.

Example:

```javascript
db.tx(function (ctx) {
    var queries = [
        ctx.none("drop table users;"),
        ctx.none("create table users(id serial not null, name text not null);")
    ];
    for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        queries.push(ctx.none("insert into users(name) values($1)", "name-" + (i + 1)));
    }
    queries.push(
        ctx.tx(function () {
            return ctx.tx(function(){
                return ctx.one("select count(*) from users");
            });
        }));
    return promise.all(queries);
})
.then(function (data) {
    console.log(data); // printing transaction result;
}, function (reason) {
    console.log(reason); // printing why the transaction failed;
})
```

Things to note from the example above:
* Sub-transactions do not declare a context parameter in their callback. It is not because
they don't receive one, they all do, but they don't care in such situation because of the shared connection
chain that will result in the same `ctx` object as for the main callback, so they just reuse it from the parent,
for simplicity;
* A nested transaction cannot be disconnected from its container, i.e. it must get into the container's promise chain,
 or it will result in an attempt to execute against an unknown connection;
* As expected, a failure on any level in a nested transaction will `ROLLBACK` and `reject` the entire chain.

###### Transactions with SAVEPOINT

`SAVEPOINT` in PostgreSQL caters for advanced transaction scenarios where partial `ROLLBACK` can be executed,
depending on the logic of the transaction.

Unfortunately, this doesn't go along with the [Promises/A+] architecture that doesn't support partial `reject`.

The only work-around via promises is to strip a transaction into individual commands and execute them as a promise
chain within a shared connection. The example below shows how this can be done.

```javascript
var sco; // shared connection object;
var txErr; // transaction error;
var txData; // transaction data;
db.connect()
    .then(function (obj) {
        sco = obj; // save the connection object;
        return promise.all([
            sco.none('begin'),
            sco.none('update users set name=$1 where id=$2', ['changed1', 1]),
            sco.none('savepoint first'), // creating savepoint;
            sco.none('update users set name=$1 where id=$2', ['changed2', 2]),
            sco.none('rollback to first') // reverting to the savepoint;
        ])
            .then(function (data) {
                txData = data; // save the transaction output data;
                return sco.none('commit'); // persist changes;
            }, function (reason) {
                txErr = reason; // save the transaction failure reason;
                return sco.none('rollback'); // revert changes;
            });
    })
    .then(function () {
        if (txErr) {
            console.log('Rollback Reason: ' + txErr);
        } else {
            console.log(txData); // successful transaction output;
        }
    }, function (reason) {
        console.log(reason); // connection issue;
    })
    .done(function () {
        if (sco) {
            sco.done(); // release the connection, if it was successful;
        }
    });
```

The issue with stripping out a transaction like this and injecting `SAVEPOINT` - it gets much more
complicated to control the result of individual commands within a transaction, you may need to check every
result and change the following commands accordingly. This is why it makes much more sense to do such
transactions inside SQL functions, and not on the client side.

### Queries and Parameters

Every connection context of the library shares the same query protocol, starting with generic method `query`, that's defined as shown below:
```javascript
function query(query, values, qrm);
```
* `query` (required) - query string that supports standard variables formatting, using $1, $2, ...etc;
* `values` (optional) - simple value or an array of simple values to replace the query variables;
* `qrm` - (optional) Query Result Mask, as explained below...

In order to eliminate the chances of unexpected query results and make code more robust, each request supports parameter `qrm`
(Query Result Mask), via type `queryResult`:
```javascript
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Query Result Mask flags;
//
// Any combination is supported, except for one + many.
queryResult = {
    one: 1,     // single-row result is expected;
    many: 2,    // multi-row result is expected;
    none: 4,    // no rows expected;
    any: 6      // (default) = many|none = any result.
};
```

In the following generic-query example we indicate that the call can return anything:
```javascript
db.query("select * from users");
```
which is equivalent to calling either one of the following:
```javascript
db.query("select * from users", undefined, queryResult.many | queryResult.none);
db.query("select * from users", undefined, queryResult.any);
db.manyOrNone("select * from users");
db.any("select * from users");
```
This usage pattern is facilitated through result-specific methods that can be used instead of the generic query:
```javascript
db.many(query, values); // expects one or more rows
db.one(query, values); // expects single row
db.none(query, values); // expects no rows
db.any(query, values); // expects anything, same as `manyOrNone`
db.oneOrNone(query, values); // expects 1 or 0 rows
db.manyOrNone(query, values); // expects anything, same as `any`
```

Each query function resolves its **data** object according to the `qrm` that was used:
* `none` - **data** is `null`. If the query returns any kind of data, it is rejected.
* `one` - **data** is a single object. If the query returns no data or more than one row of data, it is rejected.
* `many` - **data** is an array of objects. If the query returns no rows, it is rejected.
* `one` | `none` - **data** is `null`, if no data was returned; or a single object, if there was one row of data returned.
If the query returns more than one row of data, the query is rejected.
* `many` | `none` - **data** is an array of objects. When no rows are returned, **data** is an empty array.

If you try to specify `one` | `many` in the same query, such query will be rejected without executing it, telling you that such mask is not valid.

If `qrm` is not specified when calling generic `query` method, it is assumed to be `many` | `none`, i.e. any kind of data expected.

> This is all about writing robust code, when the client specifies what kind of data it is ready to handle on the declarative level,
leaving the burden of all extra checks to the library.

### Functions and Procedures
In PostgreSQL stored procedures are just functions that usually do not return anything.

Suppose we want to call function **findAudit** to find audit records by **user id** and maximum timestamp.
We can make such call as shown below:
```javascript
db.func('findAudit', [123, new Date()])
    .then(function(data){
        console.log(data); // printing the data returned
    }, function(reason){
        console.log(reason); // printing the reason why the call was rejected
    });
```
We passed it **user id** = 123, plus current Date/Time as the timestamp. We assume that the function signature matches the parameters that we passed.
All values passed are serialized automatically to comply with PostgreSQL type formats.

Method `func` accepts optional third parameter - `qrm` (Query Result Mask), the same as method `query`.

And when you are not expecting any return results, call `db.proc` instead. Both methods return a [Promise] object,
but `db.proc` doesn't take a `qrm` parameter, always assuming it is `one`|`none`.

Summary for supporting procedures and functions:
```javascript
db.func(query, values, qrm); // expects the result according to `qrm`
db.proc(query, values); // calls db.func(query, values, queryResult.one | queryResult.none)
```

### Conversion Helpers

The library provides several helper functions to convert basic javascript types into their proper PostgreSQL presentation that can be passed
directly into queries or functions as parameters. All of such helper functions are located within namespace `pgp.as`, and each function
returns a formatted string when successful or throws an error when it fails.

```javascript
pgp.as.bool(value); // returns proper PostgreSQL boolean presentation;

pgp.as.text(value); // returns proper PostgreSQL text presentation,
                    // fixing single-quote symbols, wrapped in quotes;

pgp.as.date(value); // returns proper PostgreSQL date/time presentation,
                    // wrapped in quotes;

pgp.as.csv(array);  // returns a CSV string with values formatted according
                    // to their type, using the above methods;

pgp.as.format(query, values);
            // Replaces variables in a query with their `values` as specified.
            // `values` is either a simple value or an array of simple values.
```
As these helpers are not associated with any database, they can be used from anywhere.

There are some cases where you might want to use a combination of these methods instead
of the implicit parameter formatting through query methods. For example, if you want to
generate a filter string to be used where applicable, you might use a code like this:

```javascript
function createFilter(filter){
    var cnd = []; // conditions;
    if(filter.start){
        // add start date condition;
        cnd.push(pgp.as.format("start >= $1::date", filter.start));
    }
    if(filter.end){
        // add end date condition;
        cnd.push(pgp.as.format("end <= $1::date", filter.end));
    }
    if(filter.active !== undefined){
        // add active flag;
        cnd.push(pgp.as.format("active = $1", filter.active));
    }
    if(filter.name){
        // add name-starts-with condition;
        cnd.push("name like " + pgp.as.text(filter.name + '%'));
    }
    return cnd.join(" and "); // returning the complete filter string;
}
```

# Advanced

### Initialization Options

When initializing the library, you can pass object `options` with a set of properties
for global override of the library's behaviour:
```javascript
var options = {
    // pgFormatting - redirects query formatting to PG;
    // promiseLib - overrides default promise library;
    // connect - database 'connect' notification;
    // disconnect - database 'disconnect' notification;
    // query - query execution notification.
};
var pgp = pgpLib(options);
```

Below is the list of all the properties that are currently supported.

---
* `pgFormatting`

By default, **pg-promise** provides its own implementation of the query value formatting,
using the standard syntax of $1, $2, etc.

Any query request accepts values for the variable within query string as the second parameter.
It accepts a single simple value for queries that use only one variable, as well as an array of simple values,
for queries with multiple variables in them.

**pg-promise** implementation of query formatting supports only the basic javascript types: text, boolean, date, number and null.

Those basic types are however sufficient to cover more complex scenarios. For example, binary data is exchanged with the
database using hex strings, as shown below.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');

// read in image in hex format:
fs.readFile('image.jpg', 'hex', function (err, imgData) {
    var data = '\\x' + imgData; // indicate a hex string;
    // inserting data into column 'img' of type 'bytea':
    db.query('insert into images (img) values ($1)', data)
        .then(function () {
            // success;
        }, function (reason) {
            console.log(reason); // print why it failed;
        });
});
```

If, instead, you want to use query formatting that's implemented by the [PG] library, set parameter `pgFormatting`
to be `true` when initializing the library, and every query formatting will redirect to the [PG]'s implementation.

Although this has huge implication to the library's functionality, it is not within the scope of this project to detail.
For any further reference you should use documentation of the [PG] library.

**NOTE:** As of the current implementation, formatting parameters for calling functions (methods `func` and `proc`)
is not affected by this override. If needed, use the generic `query` instead to invoke functions with redirected
query formatting.

---
* `promiseLib`

Set this property to an alternative promise library compliant with the [Promises/A+] standard.

By default, **pg-promise** uses version of [Promises/A+] provided by [Promise]. If you want to override
this and force the library to use a different implementation of the standard, just set this parameter
to the library's instance.

Example of switching over to [Bluebird]:
```javascript
var promise = require('bluebird');
var options = {
    promiseLib: promise
};
var pgp = pgpLib(options);
```

[Promises/A+] libraries that passed our compatibility test and are currently supported:

* [Promise] - used by default
* [Bluebird]
* [When]
* [Q]
* [RSVP] - doesn't have `done()`, use `finally/catch` instead
* [Lie] - doesn't have `done()`


Compatibility with other [Promises/A+] libraries though possible, is an unknown.

---
* `connect`

Global notification function of acquiring a new database connection.
```javascript
var options = {
    connect: function(client){
        var cp = client.connectionParameters;
        console.log("Connected to database '" + cp.database + "'");
    }
}
```
It can be used for diagnostics / connection monitoring within your application.

The function takes only one parameter - `client` object from the [PG] library that represents connection
with the database.

---
* `disconnect`

Global notification function of releasing a database connection.
```javascript
var options = {
    disconnect: function(client){
        var cp = client.connectionParameters;
        console.log("Disconnecting from database '" + cp.database + "'");
    }
}
```
It can be used for diagnostics / connection monitoring within your application.

The function takes only one parameter - `client` object from the [PG] library that represents the connection
that's being released.

---
* `query`

Global notification of a query that's being executed.
```javascript
var options = {
    query: function(client, query, params){
        console.log("Executing query: " + query);
    }
}
```
It can be useful for diagnostics / logging within your application.

Notification happens just before the query execution. And if the notification handler throws
an error, the query execution will be intercepted and rejected with the error that's been
thrown by the handler function.

The function receives the following parameters:
* `client` - object from the [PG] library that represents the connection;
* `query` - query that's being executed;
* `params` - query parameters (only when `pgFormatting` is set to be `true`).

Please note, that should you set property `pgFormatting` to be `true`, the library no longer formats
the queries, and the `query` arrives pre-formatted. This is why extra parameter `params` was added.

### Library de-initialization
When exiting your application, make the following call:
```javascript
pgp.end();
```
This will release pg connection pool globally and make sure that the process terminates without any delay.
If you do not call it, your process may be waiting for 30 seconds (default) or so, waiting for the pg connection pool to expire.
